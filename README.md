# Gimbal On the Car Project 
### ROS based RC car with self-stalblized camera gimbal mounted
#### Check out the porject website <http://gimbalonthecar.weebly.com>

This RC car is armed with a stabilization platform for camera, to enhance the experience of comfortable and flexible video shooting, the camera gimbal is able to detect angle change of the gimbal, and adjust gimbal axis angle to make the camera staying horizontal to the ground. The car frame is made of carbon fiber such that it is lighter and more sustainable . Besides carbon fiber, aluminum are also available for future development . The camera car is modularized. None of parts is permanently fixed, so they are removable, interchangeable. We also design a 360 degree rotational robotic arm with four-bar mechanism to enable forward and backward motion, and provide extra degrees of freedom for camera shooting angle.
